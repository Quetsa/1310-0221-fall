    <h2>Early History</h2>
        <p>Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: 
            Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
            They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students.
             They also placed certain protective enchantments in place to ensure the well-being of their students, 
             for which reason the castle and grounds had both always been protected with Anti-Apparition Charms.
             Around the same time, the four founders employed the school's first Caretaker, Hankerton Humble, 
             who would often clash with Peeves, the resident Poltergeist, 
             which he would have in common with every successive caretaker after him in the history of Hogwarts.</p>
            
        <p> Although the four founders cooperated well for a time, however, shortly after founding the school, 
            Slytherin had a falling out with the other founders about blood purity, and wanted to admit only pure-blood students.
             He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic, and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and 
             half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three founders all disagreed, especially Gryffindor. Slytherin left the school,
              but not before secretly building the Chamber of Secrets. He foretold that only his own heir would be able to open it 
              once they arrived at the school, and the heir would unleash a murderous basilisk living inside to purge the school 
              of all Muggle-born students.</p>      
    <h3>Battle of Hogwarts</h3>
    <p>In May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts took place as one of its most infamous alumni, Tom Riddle, better known by then as 
        Lord Voldemort, returned to attack the school and subdue or destroy its defenders. Voldemort claimed he had no desire to 
        harm the school or its students, but he and his Death Eaters spared no one who opposed them and recklessly damaged the school 
        during their assault.</p>
    <p>Numerous students, staff, parents, graduates, and friends of Hogwarts rose to the school's defence in its hour of need, 
        including the notorious poltergeist Peeves. Thanks to Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort was permanently destroyed and his
         Death Eaters disbanded forever. Minerva McGonagall became the Headmistress of the school. Harry was celebrated as a
          true hero.</p>
    <p> Hogwarts sustained extensive damage during the battle. Multiple areas of the main building and adjacent areas were set on
         fire or blown up, and the Quidditch pitch was largely destroyed by fire. After the battle, Hogwarts was repaired. Some 
         students, such as Hermione Granger, returned to the school in 1998 to complete their education.</p>
