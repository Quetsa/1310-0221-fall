    <h4>Sorting</h4>
        <p>In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses.
             When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor 
             took his hat off and each "put some brains" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose future students for each House.
             At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat was placed on each new student's head during the 
             Sorting Ceremony.</p>
    <h4>The Sorting Ceremony</h4>
            <p>The Sorting Hat announced the House the student was to join. Before beginning the Sorting Ceremony, 
                it sang a short song about the founding of the school and the four Houses; the Sorting Hat's songs were 
                different every year, and the Hat was said to take all year composing the next one (according to Ronald Weasley).
                Every so often it would sing of mortal peril at the school.The students said that it picked up tips from Dumbledore's office.
